JSX - JAVASCRIPT XML.

 1. JSX - Syntax extension for Javascript.
 
 2. We can write the markup inside the Javascript file.

 3. We will have a function which will return a method.
      Inside the return 
       -> We will write our Markup / HTML 

 4. We will use the curly braces to define variables inside the  Markup.

 5. We can use variables inside the JSX -> using the {}.

 6. VERY VERY IMPORTANT 
       -> return statement - it will never return more than one element.
       -> If we want multiple elements, then we need to wrap them in another parent tag.
 7. We can use Objects and map their value inside markup.

 8. We can call functions and pass parameters to the function inside the Markup.
