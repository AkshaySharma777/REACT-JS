REACT LIFECYCLE METHODS
   - A component's lifecycle has 3 main phases: 
   1) Mounting Phase.
       - The mounting phase refers to the period when a component is being created and inserted into the DOM.

   2) Updating Phase.
      - This phase occurs when a component's props or state changes, and the component needs to be updated.

   3) Unmounting Phase.
      - The unmounting phase refers to the lifecycle stage when a component is being removed from the DOM (Document Object Model) and is no longer rendered or accessible.

   -> These methods allow you to control the component's behavior and perform specific actions at different stages of its lifecycle.

 MOUNTING PHASE METHODS
   1) constructor() : 
       ->The constructor method is called when the component is first created.
       ->The constructor is called when an instance of the components is being created.
       -> You can use it to initialize state and bind event handlers.

    2) render() :
       ->This render() method is responsible for generating the component's virtual DOM representation based on its current props and state.
       -> It is called every time the component needs to be re-rendered, either because its props or state have changed, or because a parent component has been re-rendered.
